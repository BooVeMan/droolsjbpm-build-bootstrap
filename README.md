Building with Maven
===================

All projects use Maven 3 to build all their modules.

Installing Maven
----------------

* Get Maven

    * [Download Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and follow the installation instructions.

* Linux

    * Note: the `apt-get` version of maven is probably not up-to-date enough.

    * Linux trick to easily upgrade to future versions later:

        * Unzip maven to `~/opt/build`
    
        * Create a version-independent link:

                $ cd ~/opt/build/
                $ ln -s apache-maven-3.0.3 apache-maven

            Next time you only have to remove the link and add it to the new version.

        * Add this to your `~/.bashrc` file:

                export M3_HOME="~/opt/build/apache-maven"
                export PATH="$M3_HOME/bin:$PATH"

    * Give more memory to maven, so it can the big projects too:

        * Add this to your `~/.bashrc` file:

            export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

* Windows:

    * Give more memory to maven, so it can the big projects too:

        * Open menu *Configuration screen*, menu item *System*, tab *Advanced*, button *environment variables*:

            set MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

* Check if maven is installed correctly.

        $ mvn --version
        Apache Maven 3.0.3 (...)
        Java version: 1.6.0_24

    Note: the enforcer plugin enforces a minimum maven and java version.

Running the build
-----------------

* Go into a project's base directory, for example `guvnor`:

        $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm
        $ ls
        drools  droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap  droolsjbpm-build-distribution  droolsjbpm-integration  droolsjbpm-knowledge  droolsjbpm-tools  drools-planner  guvnor
        $ cd guvnor
        $ ls
        ...  guvnor-repository  guvnor-webapp  pom.xml

    Notice you see a `pom.xml` file there. Those `pom.xml` files are the heart of Maven.

* **Run the build**:

        $ mvn clean install -DskipTests

    The first build will take a long time, because a lot of dependencies will be downloaded (and cached locally).

    It might even fail, if certain servers are offline or experience hiccups.
    In that case, you 'll see an IO error, so just run the build again.

    After the first successful build, any next build should be fast and stable.

* Try running a different profile by using the option `-D<profileActivationProperty>`:

        $ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dfull

    There are 3 profile activation properties:

    * *none*: Fast, for during development

    * `full`: Slow, but builds everything (including documentation). Used by hudson and during releases.

    * `soa`: prunes away the non-enterprise stuff

* To run a maven build over all repositories (only works if you cloned all repositories):

        $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm
        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/mvn-all.sh -DskipTests clean install

    * Note: the `mvn-all.sh` script is working directory independent.

* Warning: The first `mvn` build of a day will download the latest SNAPSHOT dependencies of other droolsjbpm projects,
unless you build all those droolsjbpm projects from source.
Those SNAPSHOTS were build and deployed last night by hudson jobs.

    * If you 've pulled all changes (or cloned a repository) today, this is a good thing:
    it saves you from having to download and build all those other latest droolsjbpm projects from source.

    * If you haven't pulled all changes today, this is probably a bad thing:
    you 're probably not ready to deal with those new snapshots.

        In that case, add `-nsu` (= `--no-snapshot-updates`) to the `mvn` command to avoid downloading those snapshots:

            $ mvn clean install -DskipTests -nsu

        Note that using `-nsu` will also make the build faster.

Configuring Maven
-----------------

To deploy snapshots and releases to nexus, you need to add this to the file `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

     <settings>
       ...
       <servers>
         <server>
           <id>jboss-snapshots-repository</id>
           <username>jboss.org_username</username>
           <password>jboss.org_password</password>
         </server>
         <server>
           <id>jboss-releases-repository</id>
           <username>jboss.org_username</username>
           <password>jboss.org_password</password>
         </server>
       </servers>
       ...
     </settings>

More info in [the JBoss.org guide to get started with Maven](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Developers).

Developing with Eclipse
=======================

Before running Eclipse
----------------------

* Do not use an Eclipse version older than `3.6 (helios)`.

* Avoid an `OutOfMemoryException` and a `StackOverflowError` when building.

    Open `$ECLIPSE_HOME/eclipse.ini` and add/change this: on openFile -vmargs:

        openFile
        -vmargs
        ...
        -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
        -Xms512m
        -Xmx1024m
        -Xss1024k

* Only on Mac, also add these lines to avoid a Mac-specific p2 bug with tycho 0.11.0 in droolsjbpm-tools:

        -startup
        ../../../plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.1.0.v20100507.jar
        --launcher.library
        ../../../plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.cocoa.macosx.x86_64_1.1.1.R36x_v20100810

    TODO: Remove this note when we upgrade to tycho 0.12.0 (if that uses a p2 director that fixes it)

Configuring the project with the m2eclipse plugin
-------------------------------------------------

The m2eclipse plugin is a plugin in Eclipse for Maven.
This is the new way (and compatible with tycho).

* Open Eclipse

* Follow [the installation instructions of m2eclipse](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/).

    * Follow the link *Installing m2eclipse* at the bottom.

* Click menu *File*, menu item *Import*, tree item *Maven*, tree item *Existing Maven Projects*.

* Click button *Browse*, select a repository directory. For example `~/projects/droolsjbpm/guvnor`.

* Unfold *Advanced*, textfield *Profiles*: `notSoaProfile,fullProfile`.

Configuring the project with the deprecated maven-eclipse-plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------

The maven-eclipse-plugin plugin is a plugin in Maven for Eclipse.
This is the old way (of which the development has stopped).

Run this command to generate `.project` and `.classpath` files:

    $ mvn eclipse:eclipse

* Open Eclipse

* Menu item *Import existing projects*, navigate to the project base directory, select all the projects (= modules) it lists.

Important note: `mvn eclipse:eclipse` does not work for our eclipse plugins because it is not compatible with tycho
(and never will be).

Configuring Eclipse
-------------------

* Force language level 5 (not 6), to fail-fast on implemented interface methods that are annotated with `@Override`.

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*

    * Click tree item *Java*, tree item *Compiler*, section *JDK Compliance*, combobox *Compiler compliance level* should be `1.5`.

* Set the correct file encoding (UTF-8 except for properties files) and end-of-line characters (unix):

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.

    * Click tree item *General*, tree item *Workspace*

        * Label *Text file encoding*, radiobutton *Other*, combobox `UTF-8`.

        * Label *New text file delimiter*, radiobutton *Other*, combobox `Unix`.

    * Click tree item *XML*, tree item *XML Files*.

        * Combobox *Encoding*: `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

    * Click tree item *CSS*, tree item *CSS Files*.

        * Combobox *Encoding*: `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

    * Open tree item *HTML*, tree item *HTML Files*.

        * Combobox *Encoding*: `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

    * Note: normal i18n properties files must be in `ISO-8859-1` as specified by the java `ResourceBundle` contract.

        * Note on note: GWT i18n properties files override that and must be in `UTF-8` as specified by the GWT contract.

* Set the correct number of spaces when pressing tab:

    * Warning: If you imported the `eclipse-formatter.xml` file, you don't need to set it for Java, but you do need to set it for XML anyway!

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.

        * If you have project specific settings enabled instead, right click on the project and click the menu item *Properties*.

    * Click tree item *Java*, tree item *Code Style*, tree item *Formatter*.

        * Click button *Edit* of the active profile, tab *Indentation*

        * Combobox *Tab policy*: `spaces only`

        * Textfield *Indentation size*: `4`

        * Textfield *Tab size*: `4`

        * Note: If it is a build-in profile, you 'll need to change its name with the textfield on top.

    * Click tree item *XML*, tree item *XML Files*, tree item *Editor*.

        * Radiobutton *Indent using space*: `on`

        * Textfield *Indentation size*: `2`

        * Radiobutton *Indent using space*: `on`

        * Textfield *Indentation size*: `4`

* Set the correct file headers (do not include @author or a meaningless javadoc):

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.
    
    * Click tree item *Java*, tree item *Code Style*, tree item *Code Templates*.

    * Click tree *Configure generated code and comments*, tree item *Comments*, tree item *types*.

    * Remove the line *@author Your Name*.

        * We do not accept `@author` lines in source files, see FAQ below.

    * Remove the entire javadoc as automatically templated data is meaningless.

* Set the correct license header

    Eclipse JEE Helios currently has no build-in support of license headers, but you can configure it for new files.

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.

        * If you have project specific settings enabled instead, right click on the project and click the menu item *Properties*.

    * Click tree item *Java*, tree item *Code Style*, tree item *Copy templates*.

    * Click tree item *Comments*, tree item *Files*.

    * Replace the text area with the java multi-line comment version of

Source control with git
=======================

Installing and configuring git
------------------------------

* Install it in your OS:

    * Linux: Install the package git (and optionally gitk)

             $ sudo apt-get install git

        Tip: Also install *gitk* to visually your git log:

            $ sudo apt-get install gitk

    * Windows, Mac OSX: Download from [the git website](http://git-scm.com).

        Tip for Mac OSX: Also install [*gitx*](http://gitx.frim.nl/) to visually your git log.

    * More info [in github's git installation instructions](http://help.github.com/git-installation-redirect)

* Check if git is installed correctly.

        $ git --version
        git version 1.7.1

* Configure git correctly:

        $ git config --global user.name "My Full Name"
        $ git config --global user.email myAccount@gmail.com
        $ git config --global -l
        user.name=Geoffrey De Smet
        user.email=gds...@gmail.com

    * Warning: the field `user.name` is your full name, *not your username*.

    * Note: the field `user.email` should match an email address of your github account.

    * More info on [github](http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/).

* Get a github account

    * And add your public key on github: [Follow these instructions](http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-key).

* To learn more about git, read the free book [Git Pro](http://progit.org/book/).

Getting the sources locally
---------------------------

* First fork the repository you want to work on, for example `guvnor`:

    * Surf to [the blessed repositories on github](https://github.com/droolsjbpm) and log in.

        * Note: **Every git repository can build alone.**
        You only need to fork/clone the repositories you're interested in (`guvnor` in this case).

    * Surf to [the specific repository (`guvnor`)](https://github.com/droolsjbpm/guvnor)

    * Click the top right button *Fork*

    * Note: by forking the repository, you can commit and push your changes without our consent
    and we can easily accept or reject your changes for the blessed repository.

* Clone that fork locally:

        # First make a directory to hold all the droolsjbpm projects
        $ mkdir droolsjbpm
        $ cd droolsjbpm

        # Then clone the repository you want to clone.
        $ git clone git@github.com:MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/guvnor.git guvnor
        # Optionally clone other droolsjbpm repositories too
        $ cd guvnor
        $ ls

    * Warning: Always clone with the *SSH URL*, never clone with the *HTTPS URL* because the latter is unreliable.

    * Note: it's highly recommended to name the cloned directory the same the repository, so the helper scripts work.

    * By default you will be looking at the sources of the master branch, which can be very unstable.

        * Use git checkout to switch to a more stable branch or tag:

                $ git checkout 5.2.1.Final

Working with git
----------------

* TODO describe topic branch workflow

* Tips and tricks

    * To see the details of your local, unpushed commits:

            $ git diff origin...HEAD

    * To run a git command (except clone) over all repositories (only works if you cloned all repositories):

            $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm
            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh push

        * Note: the `git-all.sh` script is working directory independent.

        * Linux tip: Create a symbolic link to the `git-all.sh` script and place it in your `PATH` by linking it in `~/bin`:

                $ ln -s ~/projects/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh ~/bin/droolsjbpm-git

            For command line completion, add the following line in `~/.bashrc`:

                $ complete -o bashdefault -o default -o nospace -F _git droolsjbpm-git

Pull requests: patches on steroids
----------------------------------

* Creating a pull request

    * Push all your commits to your fork on github (if you haven't already).

    * Surf to your fork on github.

    * Click the button *Pull Request* on the top of the page.

* Accepting a pull request

    * Surf to the pull request page on github.

    * Review the changes

    * Click the button *Merge help* on the bottom of the page and follow the instructions of github to apply those changes on master.

Team communication
==================

To develop a great project as a team, we need to communicate efficiently as a team.

* **[Subscribe to the dev list](http://www.jboss.org/drools/lists) and check it daily.**

    * Send a summary of every important organizational or structural decision to the dev list.

    * If you push a change that can severely hinder or disrupt other developers (such as a compilation failure), notify the dev list.

* Subscribe to the RSS feeds.

    * **It's recommend to subscribe at least to the RSS feeds of the project/repostories you're working on.**

    * Prefer an RSS reader which shows which RSS articles you've already read, such as:
        
        * Thunderbird

            * Open menu *File*, menu item *Subscribe*.
            
            * Tip: create a new, seperate directory for each feed: some feeds (such as about the project you are working on) are more important to you than others.

        * [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader)

    * Subscribe to jira issue changes:

        * [JBRULES](https://issues.jboss.org/plugins/servlet/streams?key=JBRULES&os_authType=basic)

Writing documentation
=====================

* Optionally install a DocBook editor to write documentation more comfortably, such as:

    * [XMLmind Personal Edition](http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/download.shtml)

        * Open menu *Options*, menu item *Preferences...*.

        * Click tree item *Save*

            * Combobox *Encoding*: `UTF-8`

            * Textfield *Identation*: `2`

            * Textfield *Max. line length*: `120`

            * Checkbox *Before saving, make a backup copy of the file*: `off`

                * To avoid committing backups to source control.

                * Source control history is better than backups.

* To generate the html and pdf output run maven with `-Dfull`:

        $ cd droolsjbpm
        $ cd guvnor/guvnor-docs
        $ mvn clean install -Dfull
        ...
        $ firefox target/docbook/publish/en-US/html_single/index.html

* **[Read and follow the documentation guidelines](documentation-guidelines.txt).**

* The Drools Expert manual uses railroad diagrams.
    
    These are generated from a BNF file into images files with the application
    [Ebnf2ps, Automatic Railroad Diagram Drawing](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/ebnf2ps/)

Releasing
=========

Creating a release branch
-------------------------

A release branch name should always end with `.x` so it looks different from a tag name and a topic branch name.

* Simply use the script `script/branches/create-release-branches.sh` with the drools and jbpm *release branch name*:

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/branches/create-release-branches.sh 5.2.x 5.1.x

    * It does something like this for every repository:

            $ git checkout -b 5.2.x
            $ git push origin 5.2.x

* Switch back and forth from master to the release branches for all git repositories

    * If you haven't made the branches yourself, first make sure your local repository knows about them:

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh fetch

    * Use `script/branches/git-checkout-all.sh` with the drools and jbpm *release branch name*:

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/branches/git-checkout-all.sh master master
            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/branches/git-checkout-all.sh 5.2.x 5.1.x

Releasing from a release branch
-------------------------------

Warning: Use JDK 1.6, because in JDK 1.5 the module `guvnor-repository-connector-modeshape` is not build.

To produce the distribution zips, build with `-Dfull`:

    $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/mvn-all.sh -Dfull clean install

The distribution zips are in the directory `droolsjbpm-build-distribution/droolsjbpm-uber-distribution/target`.

If everything is perfect (tested by QA etc):

* Define the version and adjust the poms.

    * Note: Always use at least 3 numbers in the version: '1.0.0' is fine, `1.0` is not fine.

* Create the tag:

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/branches/create-tags.sh 5.2.1.Final 5.1.1.Final

* Deploy the artifacts:

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/mvn-all.sh -Dfull clean install

* Go to [nexus](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus), menu item *Staging repositories*, find your staging repository.

    * Button *close*

    * Button *release*

* Go to [jira](https://issues.jboss.org) and for each of our JIRA projects (JBRULES, GUVNOR, JBPM):

    * Open menu item *Administration*, link *Manage versions*, release the version.

    * Create new versions if needed.

* Warning: The slightest change after you created the tag requires the use of the next version number!

    * **NEVER TAG OR DEPLOY A VERSION THAT ALREADY EXISTS AS A TAG OR A DEPLOY!!!**

        * Except deploying `SNAPSHOT` versions.

        * Git tags are cached on developer machines forever and are never refreshed.

        * Maven non-snapshot versions are cached on developer machines and proxies forever and are never refreshed.

    * So even if the release is broken, do not reuse the same version number! Create a hotfix version.

FAQ
===

* Why do you not accept `@author` lines in your source code?

    * Because the author tags in the java files are a maintenance nightmare

        * A large percentage is wrong, incomplete or inaccurate.

        * Most of the time, it only contains the original author. Many files are completely refactored/expanded by other authors.

        * Git is accurate, that is the canonical source to find the correct author.

    * Because the author tags promote *code ownership*, which is bad in the long run.

        * If people work on a piece they perceive as being owned by someone else, they tend to:

            * only fix what they are assigned to fix, instead of everything that's broken

            * discard responsibility if that code doesn't work properly

            * be scared of stepping on the feet of the owner.
